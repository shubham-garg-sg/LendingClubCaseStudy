# Lending Club Case Study
> The aim of this project is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
> Exploratory Data Analysis performed on Python libraries

## General Information
- The objective of analysis is to use the information about past loan applicants and find out the factors impacting the loans to get ‘Defaulted’ so as to reduce the company losses incurred.
- This project is based on Exploratory Data Analysis concepts
- To analyze patterns which can prevent loans to be sanctioned to applicants who are most likely not able to repay the loan in given term
- The dataset used is loan data for all loans issued by the company from 2007 to 2011

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Data Cleaning and Manipulation performed on dataset
- Performed Univariate Analysis for Categorical variables
- Performed Univariate Analysis for Numerical variables - Segmented Analysis
- Performed Bivariate analysis
- Drawn Results from above analysis performed
